Through this Project I was build a Spam Mail Detection System using the Machine Learning Algorithms . 
I used TF-IDF method of sklearn to vectorize textual data into numeric. Then I apply cross validation to diffrent scikit-learn in-built classificaton algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors, and All Naive Bayes. Then after analysis of the cross validation results and parameter tuning, I got Support Vector Machine with its Polynomial kernel performs best with more than 99% of accuracy and f1-score. So, I 
trained this model to classify spam or ham mails. At the end of this project I developed a web Application as the final product of this project through which
a person can check a message or mail texts, to detect whether it is Spam or not.

The Web Application looks like :
